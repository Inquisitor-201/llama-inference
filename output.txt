One day, a girl named Lily went for a walk in the park. She saw a pretty bird on the ground. The bird wanted to fly high like the bird. The bird wanted to fly high in the sky.
Lily flew up to the tree and reached the bird. The bird flew down and reached the bird. The bird was flying high in the sky. The bird was flying, and the birds were happy.
A kind bird saw the bird and said, "Hi, bird! Can I fly with you?" The bird said, "Yes, you can fly too! Let's play together." They both smiled and played together all day. They had lots of fun and became good friends.<|end_story|>
